== Ser Vegano website

http://servegano.com

Animal rights advocacy website, created and managed by Nicanor Perera.

I'm sharing the code, because I think some other developers can find it useful.

Some features of this website:

* Ruby 2.1.2

* Rails 4.1.8

* CMS of pages, with different types of pages

* Uses RedCloth for markup, with a twist so that you can use images you upload.

* Postgresql as database
